# Asuna

Modular recon and vulnerability scanner based on Axiom I retired a while ago. I don't use this framework because I have rewritten everything in a cloud-native, microservice-based framework that outperforms this script by every metric.

I don't recommend ever trying to use this tool when things like ReconFTW exist - but I think it's an interesting look into what the early stages of automation in BB look like and a good example of a rabbit hole not to go down. Sorry for any crude comments.

Side note - there is no build file, all tools/reqs would need to be installed manually. Never got to the point of dockerizing it as I abandoned it for the previously mentioned project.
